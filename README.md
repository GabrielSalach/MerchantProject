# MerchantProject
Abandonned simulation/RPG set in a fantasy world where you need to manage a guild and it's members

I've been working on this project on my spare time for a few months but I took the decision to stop the development for now. 

# Pitch
You play as a guild manager, in the fantasy world of Silonia. You can recruit heroes to send on missions with exciting turn-based combat, or crafters like blacksmiths or jewellers who can create items to equip your heroes with or sell. 
Clients can enter your guild hall and buy the items you have for sale, or give you special story quests. 
Sending heroes on mission allows you to get materials and monster loot, giving you the oportunity to craft better gear as time goes on. 

# Screenshots and explainations

### Main hub

This is the guild hall, where you would spend most of your time. From here, you have access to your inventory, the map where your active quests are displayed as well as all of your characters (heroes and crafters) going on about their lives.

### Heroes

Clicking on a hero in the guild hall opens up a window displaying their name and stats. You can also open their inventory to equip them with gear, giving them better stats in combat. 

### Crafting

Clicking on a crafter opens up a window displaying all the crafting recipe they know. If you have the right amount of ingredients, they'll walk towards their crafting table and after a small amount of time, the item you asked for will be added to your inventory. 

### Inventory

Your inventory is accessible by clicking on the chest located in the guild hall. A debugging tool has been added to quickly add or remove any item in the game from your inventory. 

### Map and questing
![Capture d’écran 2022-07-08 154042](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60842220/178006512-86125fdc-ae0b-43f2-b510-8a7dc4174bd8.png)

The map displays all the quests you have unlocked so far. Material quests can give you raw materials like iron or wood and once you send a hero on this type of quest, a timer will indicate you how much time is left before your hero returns with these materials. 

### Combat quest

Quests involving combat on the other hand are divided into two more categories. Regular combat quests also work with a timer, scaling with your hero's combat abilities but be careful, as they can take damage and even die. 

### Boss quests
![Capture d’écran 2022-07-08 154125](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60842220/178007119-3d06972d-6a46-4107-8338-303ec9b38197.png)

Boss quests use turn-based combat. You can send multiple heroes on these quests and they are much more difficult as they involve strategy.


### Other informations
The game supports saving and loading the guild and heroes inventory.
Multiple classes and skills for heroes would've been supported.
